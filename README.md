# CNN-fusion-networks

The repo consist of code for paper implementations for 

1) Two-Level Attention-based Fusion Learning for RGB-D Face Recognition : <https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.00168>
published in 25th Internation Conference of Pattern Recogntion 2020
<img src = "images/full_arch.pdf", title="Two-Level Attention"/>

2) Depth as Attention for Face Representation Learning : <https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00652>
published in IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security vol 16, pp. 2461-2476, 2021
