# CNN-fusion-networks

The repo consist of code for paper implementations for 

1) Two-Level Attention-based Fusion Learning for RGB-D Face Recognition : <arXiv:2003.00168>

2) Depth as Attention for Face Representation Learning : <arXiv:2101.00652>

The attention_module.py contains different attention module and fusion technique implementation from the above papers written in Keras.
